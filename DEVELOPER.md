## Introduction

## Folder Structure

Each package is created individually and placed using the package name in a separate folder inside "packages".

Each package MUST be self containing and MUST never rely on any code outside of itself.

### Build

Based on Vue.js, all the usual targets exist. The easiest way to get started is using **build**

> npm install

> npm run build

#### Requirements

Vue.js 2.x
